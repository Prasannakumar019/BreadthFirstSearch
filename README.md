# Breadth First Search
## AIM

To develop an algorithm to find the route from the source to the destination point using breadth-first search.

## THEORY
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbour nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. BFS is a graph traversal approach in which you start at a source node and layer by layer through the graph, analyzing the nodes directly related to the source node. Then, in BFS traversal, you must move on to the next-level neighbor nodes.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Identify a location in the google map:

### STEP 2:
Select a specific number of nodes with distance

### STEP 3:
Initialize a queue. All nodes in which nearby nodes have already been visited; you must remove them from the queue.Because the queue is now empty, the bfs traversal has ended.

### STEP 4:
Include each node and its distance separately in the dictionary data structure.

### STEP 5:
End of program.
